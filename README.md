# Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page Solution

This is my solution to the [Recipe Page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). This challenge helped me practice responsive design, semantic HTML, and clean CSS structure while building a simple, beautiful recipe card.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5  
- CSS Custom Properties  
- Flexbox  
- Mobile-first responsive layout  
- Google Fonts (Outfit & Young Serif)

### What I Learned

- How to structure a clean, responsive card layout with semantic HTML.  
- How subtle styling issues (like line-height/margin collapse) can appear due to browser zoom levels.  
- Using `::marker` to customize bullet and number styles cleanly:

```css
ol li::marker,
ul li::marker {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```
- Importance of consistency in spacing/padding across screen sizes:

```
.recipe-container {
  padding: 1rem;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  .recipe-container {
    padding: 2rem;
  }
}
```

### Continued Development

- Explore utility-first frameworks like **Tailwind CSS** for faster prototyping and consistent styling.
- Focus more on **accessibility**, including proper `aria-*` attributes and color contrast checks.
- Improve mobile responsiveness by experimenting with **CSS Grid** for more complex layouts.
- Add **transitions/animations** for visual polish using `transition`, `transform`, and `:hover` states.

### Useful Resources
